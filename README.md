## Introduction
The focus of this project was the study of JavaScript Storage APIs, in this case, [`localStorage`][localStorage] API. It is expected to be migrated from `localStorage` API to `IndexedDB` API, in a future version.

While using this project, you can build your own quiz questions with tools such as `edit`, `delete`, `create` and more.
